    <h2>Project: Voyager</h2>
    <p>The first project I worked on here at the FOC, Project Voyager was all about the name change from Quicken Loans to Rocket Mortgage!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I helped to coordinate testing efforts for this project</li>
        <li>I also helped to document important meeting information and communicate out important info and meeting recaps to the team</li>
        <li>This project was a huge technology initiative and took well over a year to plan and execute.</li>
        <li>Because of the enormous nature of this project, phase 2 is still being worked on today!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project: DockerEE</h2>
    <p>The first project I was trusted to coordinate and drive towards execution, focuses on upgrading the deprecating DockerEE to Kubernetes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This was my first "Big" project as an intern, and later full-time TM TechOps Project Coordinator!</li>
        <li>This project was driven to completion in Q1-Q2 of 2022!</li>
        <li>I learned a ton of information regarding both DockerEE and Kubernetes while working on this project.</li>
        <li>This was the first project that I worked on with my friend and mentor, Amir in the TPMO (Technology Project Management Office).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project: Urban Alliance</h2>
    <p>Our high-school intern, Ishrath, won intern of the year during her time with the TPMO and Urban Alliance!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This event was the first time I met my team in the TPMO in person.</li>
        <li>We met at Bell Isle in Detroit and had an awesome time getting to chat and eat tacos!</li>
        <li>Even though most of my old team work on other teams, we still keep in touch and communicate often!</li>
    </ul>

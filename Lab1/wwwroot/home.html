    <h2>Why I love working at the FOC</h2>
        <p>
            From my first day as an intern working with the TPMO,
            I have truly felt welcomed and valued as a team member.
            I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work on huge technology
            projects as an intern and project coordinator, such as Project
            Voyager (name change from QL > RM), the very first project 
            I worked on at the FOC. The FOC has had my back as a student
            when I needed support and has continued to support me in my
            growth. I love the FOC!
        </p>

    <h2>Fun Facts About the FOC</h2>

            <li>
                I worked on a top-secret technology project that will
                be launching end of 2022 and into 2023.
            </li>
            <li>
                During my role as TechOps Project Coordinator, I developed
                automated work-flows using Microsoft Power Automate to
                streamline multiple project management processes, and they 
                are still in use to this day by the TPMO!
